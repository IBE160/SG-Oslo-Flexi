# Brainstorming Session: Monetization Strategies

**Date:** 2025-11-14

## Overview

This document outlines potential monetization strategies for the project. The goal is to identify various models that can provide sustainable revenue while delivering value to users.

## 1. Tiered Subscription Model

- **Concept:** Offer multiple subscription tiers (e.g., Free, Pro, Team, Enterprise) with progressively more features, higher usage limits, and better support.
- **Free Tier:** Basic features, limited usage (e.g., 3 projects, 100 API calls/month), community support. Designed to let users experience the core product.
- **Pro Tier:** For individuals and small teams. Unlocks advanced features, higher limits, and email support.
- **Team/Business Tier:** Adds collaboration features, role-based access control, and priority support.
- **Enterprise Tier:** Custom pricing for large organizations. Includes everything from Business plus features like SSO, dedicated account manager, on-premise deployment options, and security audits.

## 2. Usage-Based (Pay-As-You-Go) Model

- **Concept:** Users pay only for what they use. This is common for API-based products.
- **Metrics:** Could be based on API calls, data processed (e.g., per GB), number of agents run, or compute time.
- **Pros:** Flexible for users with variable workloads. Low barrier to entry.
- **Cons:** Unpredictable revenue stream. Can be complex to track and bill.

## 3. Freemium with Paid Add-ons

- **Concept:** Offer a robust free core product that is genuinely useful on its own. Charge for optional, powerful add-ons or extensions.
- **Examples of Add-ons:**
  - Advanced analytics and reporting.
  - Specialized agent templates (e.g., for legal, medical).
  - Integrations with premium third-party services (e.g., Salesforce, SAP).

## 4. Marketplace Model

- **Concept:** Create a marketplace where users and third-party developers can buy and sell assets.
- **Assets:** Could include prompts, agent configurations, workflow templates, or custom components.
- **Revenue:** The platform takes a percentage commission on each transaction.
- **Pros:** Creates a network effect and enriches the ecosystem.
- **Cons:** Requires a critical mass of buyers and sellers to be successful.

## 5. Hybrid Models

- **Concept:** Combine elements from different models.
- **Example:** A subscription plan that includes a certain amount of usage, with overage charges for users who exceed their limits. This provides revenue predictability while still capturing value from high-usage customers.

## Comparison with Existing Brainstorming

- This is a new topic. Previous sessions focused on technical implementation, product features, and QA, but not on the business model. This session fills a critical gap in the project's overall strategy.
