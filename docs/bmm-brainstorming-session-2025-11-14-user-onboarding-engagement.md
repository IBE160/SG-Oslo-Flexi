**Date:** 2025-11-14

## Overview

This document explores ideas for creating a smooth and engaging onboarding process to help new users understand the product's value and encourage long-term engagement.

---

## 1. The First-Time User Experience (FTUE)

- **Interactive Tutorial:**
  - A guided, step-by-step walkthrough of the core workflow (e.g., creating a first agent, running a simple task).
  - Avoid a long, passive tour. Let the user learn by doing.
  - Use tooltips and hotspots to point out key UI elements contextually.

- **"Getting Started" Checklist:**
  - An in-app checklist that guides users through key activation milestones (e.g., "Create a project," "Invite a team member," "Run your first workflow").
  - Provides a sense of accomplishment and clear direction.

- **Welcome Modal:**
  - A simple modal on first login that greets the user and asks about their primary goal or use case. This can be used to personalize their experience.

## 2. Educational Content & Resources

- **Welcome Email Sequence:**
  - A drip campaign of 3-5 emails sent over the first week.
  - **Email 1:** Welcome & key value proposition.
  - **Email 2:** Link to a quick-start guide or video tutorial.
  - **Email 3:** Showcase an advanced feature or a specific use case.
  - **Email 4:** Invite them to the community or to a webinar.

- **Template & Sample Library:**
  - Provide a rich library of pre-built projects, agents, and workflows.
  - Users can clone these to get started quickly and see best practices in action.

- **In-App Help Center:**
  - A searchable knowledge base accessible from within the application.
  - Include FAQs, short video tutorials, and links to detailed documentation.

## 3. Engagement & Retention Strategies

- **Community Building:**
  - Create a Discord server or a dedicated community forum.
  - A place for users to ask questions, share their creations, and connect with the development team and other users.

- **Regular Communication:**
  - A monthly newsletter with product updates, new features, and community highlights.
  - In-app notifications about new features or important updates (use sparingly).

- **Usage-Triggered Notifications:**
  - Send emails or notifications based on user behavior.
  - **Example (Positive):** "Congrats on running your 10th workflow! Here's a tip for an advanced feature you might like."
  - **Example (Re-engagement):** "We've missed you! Here's what's new since you've been away."

## Comparison with Existing Brainstorming

- This topic is related to "UI/UX Design" and "User Flows" but focuses specifically on the new user journey and long-term retention.
- While "User Flows" might define *how* a user accomplishes a task, this session focuses on *why* and *how* we should guide them through those flows initially to ensure they succeed and stay engaged.
